In this task, we are supposed to create a table called "Orders", input the data in our table and then write an SQL query to find the total amount spent by each customer who has placed more than one order. The result should include:

1. The customer ID
2. The total amount spent
3. The total number of orders
  
Finally, we are supposed to sort the results by the total amount spent in descending order.

- Output1.PNG shows my results once I select the data from the table after creating the table and inserting records.
- Output2.PNG shows the total amount spent by each customer who has placed more than one order including the customer ID, total amount spent and total number of orders.
